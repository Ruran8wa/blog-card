Thanks for checking out my solution to the [Blog preview card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS). Frontend Mentor challenges provide a platform to enhance coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The Challenge

my challenge was to build out this blog preview card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I was allowed to use any tools i wanted to help me complete the challenge.

My users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### What I learned

I improved my understanding of HTML and CSS, focusing on responsive design.

### Continued development

I plan to continue focusing on responsive design and explore more advanced CSS techniques.

### Useful resources
